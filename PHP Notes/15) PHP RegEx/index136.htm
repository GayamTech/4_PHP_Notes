Using preg_match_all():


The preg_match_all() function will tell you how many matches were found for a pattern in a string.-->

Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive count of the number of occurrences of "ain" in a string:

Regular Expression Functions:




PHP provides a variety of functions that allow you to use regular expressions. The preg_match(), preg_match_all() and preg_replace() functions are some of the most commonly used ones:





Function                Description

preg_match()            Returns 1 if the pattern was found in the string and 0 if not


preg_match_all()        Returns the number of times the pattern was found in the
                        string, which may also be 0


preg_replace()          Returns a new string where matched patterns have been
                        replaced with another string

Using preg_match():



The preg_match() function will tell you whether a string contains matches of a pattern.

Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for "w3schools" in a string:

Regular Expression Modifiers:


Modifiers can change how a search is performed.



Modifier            Description

i                   Performs a case-insensitive search

m                   Performs a multiline search (patterns that search for the
                    beginning or end of a string will match the beginning or end of each line)

u                   Enables correct matching of UTF-8 encoded patterns

Regular Expression Patterns:



Brackets are used to find a range of characters:



Expression          Description

[abc]               Find one character from the options between the brackets

[^abc]              Find any character NOT between the brackets

[0-9]               Find one character from the range 0 to 9

Metacharacters:



Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:



Metacharacter           Description


|                       Find a match for any one of the patterns separated by | as
                        in: cat|dog|fish

.                       Find just one instance of any character

^                       Finds a match as the beginning of a string as in: ^Hello

$                       Finds a match at the end of the string as in: World$

\d                      Find a digit

\s                      Find a whitespace character

\b                      Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD,
                        or at the end of a word like this: WORD\b

\uxxxx                  Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal
                        number xxxx

Quantifiers:


Quantifiers define quantities:




Quantifier          Description


n+                  Matches any string that contains at least one n

n*                  Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n

n?                  Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

n{x}                Matches any string that contains a sequence of X n's

n{x,y}              Matches any string that contains a sequence of X to Y n's

n{x,}               Matches any string that contains a sequence of at least X n's

Note: If your expression needs to search for one of the special characters you can use a backslash ( \ ) to escape them. For example, to search for one or more question marks you can use the following expression: $pattern = '/\?+/';
