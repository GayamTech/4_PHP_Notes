PHP Loops:

Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.

Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.








In PHP, we have the following loop types:


while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true

do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true

for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times

foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array






The following chapters will explain and give examples of each loop type.

The PHP while Loop:

The while loop executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.




Syntax:

while (condition is true) {
  code to be executed;
}

Example Explained
$x = 1; - Initialize the loop counter ($x), and set the start value to 1
$x <= 5 - Continue the loop as long as $x is less than or equal to 5
$x++; - Increase the loop counter value by 1 for each iteration
