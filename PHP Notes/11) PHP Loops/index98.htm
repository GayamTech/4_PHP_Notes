PHP Loops:

Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.

Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.








In PHP, we have the following loop types:


while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true

do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true

for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times

foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array






The following chapters will explain and give examples of each loop type.

The PHP foreach Loop:


The foreach loop works only on arrays, and is used to loop through each key/value pair in an array.




Syntax:


foreach ($array as $value) {
  code to be executed;
}


For every loop iteration, the value of the current array element is assigned to $value and the array pointer is moved by one, until it reaches the last array element.
