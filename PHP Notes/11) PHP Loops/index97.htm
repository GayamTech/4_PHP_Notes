PHP Loops:

Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.

Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.








In PHP, we have the following loop types:


while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true

do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true

for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times

foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array






The following chapters will explain and give examples of each loop type.

The PHP for Loop:


The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times the script should run.



Syntax :


for (init counter; test counter; increment counter) {
  code to be executed for each iteration;
}





Parameters:

init counter: Initialize the loop counter value
test counter: Evaluated for each loop iteration. If it evaluates to TRUE, the loop continues. If it evaluates to FALSE, the loop ends.
increment counter: Increases the loop counter value

This example counts to 100 by tens:

Example Explained:




$x = 0; - Initialize the loop counter ($x), and set the start value to 0

$x <= 100; - Continue the loop as long as $x is less than or equal to 100

$x+=10 - Increase the loop counter value by 10 for each iteration
