PHP Loops:

Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.

Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.








In PHP, we have the following loop types:


while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true

do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true

for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times

foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array






The following chapters will explain and give examples of each loop type.

PHP Continue:



The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

This example skips the value of 4:
