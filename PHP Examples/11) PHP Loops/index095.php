PHP Loops:

Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.

Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.








In PHP, we have the following loop types:


while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true

do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true

for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times

foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array






The following chapters will explain and give examples of each loop type.

The PHP do...while Loop :

The do...while loop will always execute the block of code once, it will then check the condition, and repeat the loop while the specified condition is true.






Syntax :


do {
  code to be executed;
} while (condition is true);

This example sets the $x variable to 6, then it runs the loop, and then the condition is checked:
