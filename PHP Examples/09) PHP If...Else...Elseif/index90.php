PHP Conditional Statements :


Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions. You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.






In PHP we have the following conditional statements:

if statement - executes some code if one condition is true

if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false

if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions

switch statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed

PHP - The if...elseif...else Statement:


The if...elseif...else statement executes different codes for more than two conditions.





Syntax:



if (condition) {
  code to be executed if this condition is true;
} elseif (condition) {
  code to be executed if first condition is false and this condition is true;
} else {
  code to be executed if all conditions are false;
}

Output "Have a good morning!" if the current time is less than 10, and "Have a good day!" if the current time is less than 20. Otherwise it will output "Have a good night!":
