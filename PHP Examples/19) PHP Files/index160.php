PHP Open File - fopen():


A better method to open files is with the fopen() function. This function gives you more options than the readfile() function.








We will use the text file, "webdictionary.txt", during the lessons:

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language
PHP = PHP Hypertext Preprocessor
SQL = Structured Query Language
SVG = Scalable Vector Graphics
XML = EXtensible Markup Language





The first parameter of fopen() contains the name of the file to be opened and the second parameter specifies in which mode the file should be opened. The following example also generates a message if the fopen() function is unable to open the specified file:

The file may be opened in one of the following modes:




Modes           Description



r               Open a file for read only. File pointer starts at the beginning of
                the file


w               Open a file for write only. Erases the contents of the file or
                creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file


a               Open a file for write only. The existing data in file is preserved.
                File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist


x               Creates a new file for write only. Returns FALSE and an error if
                file already exists

r+              Open a file for read/write. File pointer starts at the beginning of
                the file

w+              Open a file for read/write. Erases the contents of the file or
                creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file

a+              Open a file for read/write. The existing data in file is preserved.
                File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist
